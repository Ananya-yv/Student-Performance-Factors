# Student Performance Factors
This repository contains a python project analysing students scores based on various factors.

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to identify the most significant predictors of student success and examine how various factors—both academic and non-academic—interact to influence performance.
By using advanced statistical techniques and python libraries, this project seeks to uncover trends and validate hypotheses.

### Tools used:
- <code>pandas</code>: data structuring, cleaning and extraction
- <code>numpy</code>: statistical computations
- <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>seaborn</code>: visualizing data to identify relatioships and patterns
- <code>scikit-learn.impute</code>: data cleaning, removing null values
- <code>scikit-learn.preprocessing</code>: Encoding categorical data into numerical

### Key hypotheses explored include:

- Does studying more hours directly result in better exam scores?
- How does teacher quality influence performance?
- Is there a correlation between physical activity and cognitive function, as reflected in exam scores?
